### Useful Resources ###

* For help with things like tables, figures, algorithms, code highlighting etc., you can refer to the [LaTeX Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX)
* For your figures, try to use vector graphics formats wherever possible. A great open source tool for this is [Inkscape](https://www.inkscape.org)
* The suggested workflow is to create the figure and save it (for future modification) in scalable vector graphics (SVG) format, then export to PDF when you are ready to include it in your document.
* If you have raster images, you can also edit these using the [open source tool GIMP](https://www.gimp.org)
