# Random numerical semigroups and sums of subsets of cyclic groups

Undergraduate Thesis. Santiago Morales @ Uniandes

## Abstract 

We investigate properties of random numerical semigroups using a probabilistic model based on
the Erdös-Rényi model for random graphs and propose a new probabilistic model. We provide
a new and more elementary proof of a lower bound of the expected embedding dimension,
genus, and Frobenius number of a random semigroup, and provide a tighter probabilistic upper
bound. Our results derive from the application of the Probabilistic Method to the generation
of random numerical semigroups and observations about sums of uniformly random subsets
of cyclic groups. We include experiments that motivated our results and offer conjectures for
subsequent research.
