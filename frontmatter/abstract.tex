\chapter*{Abstract}

We investigate properties of random numerical semigroups using a probabilistic model based on the Erdos-Renyi model for random graphs and propose a new probabilistic model. We provide a new proof of the bounds for the expected embedding dimension, genus, and Frobenius numbers of random semigroups without using the simplicial complex correspondence, and provide a tighter probabilistic bound. Our results derive from the application of the probabilistic method to the generation of random numerical semigroups and observations about sums of uniformly random subsets of cyclic groups. We include experiments that motivated our results and offer conjectures for subsequent research.
