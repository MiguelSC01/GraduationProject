Furthermore, a special thanks to John Goodrick for introducing me to the theory of computation and for his help and advice. In addition, a big thank you goes to the Polymath Jr. program, especially to Christopher O'Neill for introducing me to numerical semigroups, and to Johanna Franklin, for being cool mentors and for their support in guiding me into the world of research. I am also grateful to Alexander Getmanenko for his insightful seminars and book picks, to Adolfo Quiroz for his fun and engaging classes, as well as his advice, and to Monika Winklmeier, Ramiro de la Vega, Mauricio Velasco and Mauricio Junca for their exceptional teaching.
